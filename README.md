# Project Euler 039 - Integer Right Triangles

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p <= n, is the number of solutions maximised?

The aim is to investigate using HTML Forms and JavaScript.
